Over the next 16 years his team breeds 6,000 different strains of diseases. Resistent-wheat, including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li>
        <li><span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to geow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
        <li><span>1953</span> - Crosses a short, study dwarf breed with high-yielding American breed, reating a strain that responds well with the fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
